3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Day of the Week)
      Approach: I accepted 3 integer value as command line argument for month, date and year.
    we used following steps to represent and write the day of week in terms of numeric value .
      y0 = y − (14 − m)/12,
    x0 = y0 + y0/4 − y0/100 + y0/400,
    m0 = m + 12 × ((14 − m)/12) − 2,
    dow = (d + x0 + 31 × m0/12) mod 7.
      Issues and resolution: I had issue when not using the floored division but when I used
      floored division which made my answer  non fractional which was required output.

   Problem 2 (Mercator Projection)
      Approach: I imported math function . I used command line argument to get value for longitude,
      used  math. radian  to convert to   radians . I followed the steps
      given in  write up and wrote the corresponding value of x and y in the output.


      Issues and resolution: I had issue with getting the output when i forgot to convert the value
      to radians.

   Problem 3 (Great Circle Distance)
      Approach: I imported math function  accepted x1 (float), y1 (float), x2 (float), and y2
      (float) as command-line arguments, representing the latitude and longitude in degrees of two
      points on Earth, and wrote the great circle distance using the formula given
      Issues and resolution: I had issue with parenthesis management.

   Problem 4 (Wind Chill)
      Approach: I  got the float value for temperature  and wind speed using command line arguments
      and used the formula given to find the effective temperature.

      Issues and resolution: I had no issue with this problem.

   Problem 5 (Gravitational Force)
      Approach: I wrote a program which accepts two masses, and distance as a float  and computed
      the gravitational force using the formula given , using the constant value of G.


      Issues and resolution: I had no issue with this problem.

   Problem 6 (Snell's Law)
      Approach: I used math function and used it to calculate the angle of refraction using the
      formula given  to find the angle of refraction.

      Issues and resolution:  I did not have any issue with this project .

   Problem 7 (Gambler's Ruin)
      Approach: I accepted n1 , n2 , and p  as command-line arguments, and wrote   the probabilities p1 and p2 to
      standard output, separated by a space using the given formula.

      Issues and resolution: I had issue with writing the formula correctly while coding.

   Problem 8 (Waiting Time)
      Approach: I wrote program that accepted λ (float) and t (float) as command-line arguments, and
          writes the probability p to standard output using the formula given in the writeup .

      Issues and resolution: I had issue writing λ so wrote it as variable lambda.

   Problem 9 (Die Roll)
      Approach: I accepted integer  n as command line argument , used stdrandom.uniformInt() with
      argument to stimulate a single roll of an n-sided die and wrote it to output.

      Issues and resolution: There was no error in this problem too.

   Problem 10 (Three Sort)
      Approach: I accepted 3 integer and used max() and min() to find the maximum and minimum value
      between the integer entered. I subtracted the smallest and highest from the 3 integer to find
      the middle value and printed to output in ascending order.

      Issues and resolution: There was no error in the problem too.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

 This was my first project in python. This project was fun to work on as the information provided my
  professor made a lot easier to work on the given project. I learned  to check the coding style,
  used different functions, and have idea of using formula to solve problems in python.I learned
  problem solving strategy. I think these python problem can help me a lot in tackling the future
  projects and has certainly boosted my confidence.
