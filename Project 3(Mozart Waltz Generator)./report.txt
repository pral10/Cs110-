3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Generating the Waltz)
      Approach: I created the 2D list with the dimension 11 * 16 using the function stdarray.create
      .2D()  filled with minuet measures, which is  read from the standard input. Similarly, I
      read the trio measures  from standard input into the 2D list of dimension 6 * 16. I wrote the
      standard output of the random sequences of 16 minuet measures , which was the value i got
      from the minute table of two dimension matrix. The value for choosing index for  column was
      done  by generating the random integer between the value of [1,15] and the index for the row
      in the minute measure was the sum of  two dice roll which was the value between [0,10]. Like
      wise the random sequences of the 16 trio measures was written to standard output where the
      column index  was determined by the random value obtained between the [0,15] during each
      iteration, and row index was the value between[0,5] which was the value obtained by rolling
      the die at each iteration. In this way the 16 minute measures and 16 trio measures read from
      standard input were written to the standard output using the loops and randomly generated
      value.



      Issues and resolution: This was the problem which  made me familiar to read the values from
      standard Input and work on those value.

   Problem 2 (Playing the Waltz)
      Approach: In this problem I read the output of earlier program(generating the
      waltz) as the standard  input for this problem. I read the waltz measures from the standard
      input into the 1D list. I checked different conditions before playing the sound related to
      corresponding measure. In this problem I checked the condition if the number of measures was
      not equals to 32 , exited with the message “A waltz must contain exactly 32 measures”,
      similarly condition was for the minute measures in this condition our minute measures i.e the
      first 16 value of the measures were checked if the value was not in range between [1,176] the
      program was exited with the message “A minuet measure must be from [1, 176]”, and remaining
      measures if were not in range of [1, 96], we exited with the message “A trio measure must
      be from [1, 96]”. If all the conditions were satisfied , I played the sound with the
      corresponding measures. 16 Minute measures were played by calling the stdaudio.playFile
      (filename) where filename was set to according the value of minute measure and trio measures
      for rest last 16 value was played setting the filename according to the value of trio measures
      .

      Issues and resolution: It was fun problem to work with , which was the linked problem with the
       earlier one. I had great time working with this project . The problem introduced to the new
       header function stdaudio relating to working with sound in the problem.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.
 This project 3 was really helpful , I worked with the arrays and had more idea of working with the
 arrays.  Also working with the sound was fun as i had some amazing time ending up getting results
 that made me happy . I am looking forward to getting more project relating to generating much fun
 output that would be fun to work with. Yet again the instructions provided were much more helpful
 to solve the problems.
